Police refused to answer when protesters asked why they were being arrested. At 2:20 in the instagram video, the filmer asks why the protester was tased, but this appears to be erroneous; the protester was pepper-sprayed.\n\nPolice then attempted to clear the protesters from the sidewalk into the lawn of a shopping center. One protester remained seated and police manhandled her.\n\nSeveral protesters, including the filmer, shouted at the police for treating the protester roughly. The officer then told these protesters to back up. They obeyed. The officer then pepper sprayed them repeatedly as they walked away. Police continued to harass protesters, pushing them from the sidewalk to the lawn. It is unclear why police asserted the sidewalk was an unacceptable place to stand.\n\nFrom an article in the Arizona Mirror, Tempe police are allowed to use pepper spray \"against violent or non-compliant subjects, and on vicious animals.\" In addition, they must give verbal warning that they will escalate. No such warning was given.",

Video shows police shooting rubber bullets at protesters on a sidewalk and firing gas canisters, in large number, at a small group of peaceful protesters.

Police say they also used smoke canisters.)\n\nPolice claim they used force to disperse the crowd after rocks and glass were thrown at them. Police also said at the time that \"Molotov cocktails\" were thrown at them. They later walked that statement back to say that one Molotov Cocktail was thrown. They say it did not ignite. Media and protesters present say they saw water bottles being thrown, but not glass, rocks, or a Molotov cocktail. Video released by police clearly shows something being thrown at police, but doesn\"t show what it was. Police also produced a picture of a crushed water bottle and what looks like a water pump and implied it was the remnants of a Molotov cocktail.\n\nNOTE: this incident immediately follows wi-milwaukee-1.

It appears that one officer and one protester got into a verbal altercation, after which the two go to the ground, grappling. The officer ends up holding the protester down, but it is difficult to determine how the incident began. This protester was apparently the father of Zane James. After this, protesters and police both became agitated and the scuffle escalated.\n\nPolice made 9 arrests, including the father of Zane James. Police beat multiple protesters with batons and pepper sprayed others. A Cottonwood Heights city councilwoman stated she was struck by police. Police state that one officer was choked to the point of unconsciousness and another was hospitalized. In addition, police state protesters used a water gun filled with \"pepper and bodily fluids;\" protesters state they were full of water in order to keep cool. A news report also states that some protesters were tased.",

Another counter-protester is trying to intervene but being physically restrained by CVP protesters; a third is filming the incident as CVP protesters heckle her. Photos taken after the incident show at least two of the protesters badly beaten. Each side says the other started the altercation.\n\nPolice arrived shortly thereafter. They told the counter-protesters to wait in police cars (allegedly for their own protection); the counter-protesters say they were kept in police cars for nearly an hour. The CVP protesters were not put into police cars. One counter-protester says that counter-protesters tried to leave multiple times, but were told that they were not free to go. Police can be seen shaking the hand of one of the CVP protesters; counter-protesters claim police were somewhat dismissive of their allegations of assault against the CVP protesters.

Protesters hands were zip tied excessively tightly behind their backs and they were loaded onto buses and driven around the city. Some were taken to a temporary field jail at UCLA\"s Jackie Robinson stadium; UCLA claims it \"failed to stop\" LAPD from using the stadium as a \"staging area,\" but was not told about the field jail until after the fact. Arestees were detained for long periods, still in excessively tight zip ties. Social distancing procedures were not observed.\n\nMany protesters allege that conditions in the makeshift jails were poor -- detainees denied medical attention and permission to use the restroom, for instance -- and that they were released, many with dead phones, in unfamiliar places in the middle of the night with no way to get home. Two arrestees allege that police prevented them from leaving before the curfew went into effect, then arrested them for violating the curfew. One arrestee alleges that she was twice threatened with guns, that she was sexually assaulted by police, and that police mocked detainees having panic attacks. Police also allegedly arrested at least one homeless person (to whom the curfew was not supposed to apply) for a curfew violation.\n\nA lawsuit has been filed in connection with these and other abuses by the National Lawyers\" Guild; a separate lawsuit has been filed by one of the arrestees.
